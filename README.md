#Memory Allocation
Memory allocation in C++ is the process of reserving a block of memory for variables, objects, or data structures. C++ provides two primary methods for memory allocation: static and dynamic. Static allocation occurs at compile-time, while dynamic allocation happens at runtime using operators such as new and delete.
######Pointers to Members
In C++, pointers to members allow you to point to member variables or member functions of a class. These pointers are different from regular pointers because they refer to a class's specific member rather than a standalone object. You must use a specific syntax to work with them.
------>References
In C++, references are an alias for an existing variable. Unlike pointers, references must be initialized when they are declared, and they cannot be reassigned to reference another object. They are commonly used for function parameters to avoid copying and to allow the modification of the original variable.
------>switch Statement
The switch statement is a control flow statement that allows you to execute one out of multiple code blocks based on the value of a variable. It is often used when there are many possible conditions to check, making the code more readable and efficient compared to using multiple if-else statements.
